# Fantastically-Unbelievably-Craterous-Killing-Survival
The modpack in this repository works with multimc only at the moment, support for other distribution methods (curse, atlauncher, etc.)
will come as the modpack is developed.

# Mod list :

unavailable (as of 4.26.20)

- Shader support:
This mod pack has optifine support, but it is only really for performance, shaders do work, but only a few have decent enough compatibility not to look weird.

semi-compatible:
sildurs vibrant shaders lite
beyond belief legacy final (only during the day)
kuda shaders
sues shaders
